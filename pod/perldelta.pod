=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

C<Configure> probed for the return type of malloc() and free() by testing
whether declarations for those functions produced a function type mismatch with
the implementation.  On Solaris, with a C++ compiler, this check always failed,
since Solaris instead imports malloc() and free() from C<std::> with C<using>
for C++ builds.  Since the return types of malloc() and free() are well defined
by the C standard, skip probing for them.  C<Configure> command-line arguments
and hints can still override these type in the unlikely case that is needed.

=head1 Testing
